# Facial-Recoginition-by-siamese-neural-network

## I. Introduction: 
This project is to implement facial recognition by siamese neural network for one shot image classification. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have become the state of the art methods for image classification tasks. However, one of the biggest limitations is they require a lots of labelled data. In many applications, collecting this much data is sometimes not feasible. One Shot Learning aims to solve this problem.

Siamese network takes two different inputs passed through two similar subnetworks with the same architecture, parameters, and weights. The two subnetworks are a mirror image of each other, just like the Siamese twins. Positive data pair is when both the inputs are the same, and a negative pair is when the two inputs are dissimilar.
